## Extensions

The `extensions`{:class="block3extensions"} library allows you to add new blocks to the blocks menu with additional features.

[[[scratch3-text-to-speech]]]

[[[generic-scratch3-add-pen-extension]]]

[[[generic-scratch3-add-music-extension]]]

There are also Video Sensing and Translate extensions.

If you are using a Raspberry Pi computer then you can also use extensions for using electronics with the Raspberry Pi (you will need extra components or a Sense Hat):

[[[rpi-scratch-add-simple-electronics]]]

[[[rpi-scratch3-add-sensehat-extension]]]
