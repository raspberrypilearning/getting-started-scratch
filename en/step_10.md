title: Duplicate and edit a costume to use in an animation
---

Some Scratch sprites just have one costume, or have multiple costumes that don't work as an animation. If you choose one costume, then duplicate it (make a copy of it) and make a small change, it can create an animation effect.

**Robot animation**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/436260207/editor){:target="_blank"}

<div class="scratch-preview">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/436260207/?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

Switch to the **Costumes** tab for your sprite. 

Choose the costume that you want to use, and delete the other costumes, because you will not need them for your animation. For example, the **Robot** sprite comes with costumes for three different robots, so you should choose one of the costumes and delete the other costumes.

Right-click on the costume (or on a tablet, tap and hold), and choose **duplicate**. 

Make small changes to the copy of the costume. For example, you can move, rotate, or change all or part of the costume. You can also add movement lines. 

If your costume uses vector graphics, then you can select parts of a costume and change each part separately.

![Animated gif showing changes to Robot costume](images/edit-robot-costume.gif)

You can duplicate the costume again and make more changes to add more frames to your animation.

You can now use your costumes in a simple sprite animation.

title: Use the Fill tool to change the colours in a costume
---

You can change the colour of your sprite. First, select your sprite in the Sprite list below the Stage and then click on the **Costumes** tab.

Use the **Select (Arrow)** tool to highlight the part of the costume you want to change colour.

![Image showing Arrow tool in Paint editor](images/challenge1-arrow-tool.png){:width="200px"}

![Image showing Arrow tool selecting shape](images/challenge1-arrow-tool-selecting-shape.png){:width="300px"}

Go to the **Fill** colour chooser and select a colour. It will automatically fill the shape that you have selected.

![Image showing Fill tool in Paint editor](images/challenge1-fill-tool.png){:width="300px"}

Repeat the steps above for any part of the costume you have missed, or for any other part of the costume you want to change colour.

title: Create scenery as sprites

---

**Hill as a sprite**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/452582516/editor){:target="_blank"}

![Hills image](images/challenge2-sprite-hill.png){:width="400px"}

To make your own **Hill** sprite, shown in the example above, you can use the **Circle** and **Rectangle** tools in the Paint editor:

+ Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select **Paint** to create a new sprite costume.

![Make a hill as one sprite costumes](images/challenge2-backdrop-sprite-costume.gif){:width="400px"}

+ Choose a **Fill** colour. Click on **Outline** and deselect it (to do this, click on the box with the diagonal line in the bottom left-hand corner of the menu). Now, use the **Circle** tool to draw an oval. Then, select the **Rectangle** tool and draw a rectangle underneath the oval.

+ If you use varying colours for the shapes, you may need to use the **Front** and **Back** tools in the Paint editor to move your shapes forward or backward so that they are positioned correctly within your background.

+ You can select all the shapes and **Group** them together so that you can adjust them or move them as one shape.

![Group shapes](images/challenge2-group-shapes.png){:width="400px"}

Now, make other sprites for your scenery, if this fits in with your project idea.

Remember to name your sprite(s).

title: Use the Line tool to create a triangle

---

You can create polygons such as a triangle and use these shapes to create roofs or mountains.

Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select **Paint** to create a new sprite costume. In this example, you will make houses.

**House**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/453595663/editor){:target="_blank"}

![Make houses as one sprite costumes](images/challenge2-backdrop-sprite-costumes-line-tool.gif){:width="400px"}

If you follow the instructions below, you can use the **Line** tool to create any shape:
+ Choose a **Fill** colour. To choose the colour black, decrease the **Brightness** to zero (0).

![Colour to black](images/challenge2-black.png){:width="150px"}

+ Select **No outline**.

![No outline to black](images/challenge2-nooutline.png){:width="200x"}

+ Use the **Rectangle** tool to draw a rectangle.
+ Use the **Line** tool to draw a triangle. Make sure that you complete the triangle, otherwise it will not fill with colour.
+ Move the two shapes together.
+ Select the **Fill (Bucket)** tool and fill the triangle with colour.
+ Use the **Rectangle** tool to draw another rectangle for the chimney.
+ You can use the **Front** and **Back** tools in the Paint editor to move your shapes forward or backward so that they are positioned correctly. In this example, you will not need to do this because the shapes are black for the silhouette.
+ Select all the shapes and **Group** them together so that you can adjust them or move them as one shape.

To create duplicate shapes of your house (for example, to make a skyline), follow the **Information** under 'Duplicate shapes to create a scenery costume' below.

title: Duplicate shapes to create a scenery costume

---

You may want to duplicate shapes within a costume so that your scenery appears busier or more crowded.

**Multiple clouds**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/447278432/editor){:target="_blank"}

![Multiple cloud shapes](images/challenge2-sprite-costume-multiples.png){:width="400px"}

The effect of multiplying shapes is used by professional animators to create the impression of weather patterns such as rain or clouds, a cluster of objects such as buildings or a wood, as well as a crowd of people in a scene.

--- no-print ---

![Costume with multiple cloud shapes](images/challenge2-sprite-costume-multiples.gif)

--- /no-print ---

To multiply any type of shape:
+ Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select, in this example, the **Cloud** sprite.
+ In the **Costumes** tab, use the **Select** tool to highlight the whole of the shape.
+ Use the **Copy** and **Paste** tools to create duplicates of the shape.
+ Use the **Select** tool to move the shape within the Paint editor.
+ You can vary the size of the shapes to help to create a greater sense of 3D effects, for example.
+ You can select all the shapes and **Group** them together so that you can adjust them or move them as one shape.

title: Use Saturation and Brightness to create depth

---

In the real world, objects that are further away appear lighter in colour. To achieve more realistic 3D scenery, you can **decrease** the colour **Saturation** and/or **Brightness** of each sprite so that they appear further and further away.

Click on the **Select (Arrow)** tool and select your text. Drag the corner handles to resize your text:
![Show Arrow tool and resize handles](images/from-me-arrow-resize.png){:width="300px"}

Do you want to change the **Fill** colour? Select the **Fill (Bucket)** tool and hover over your text. It will automatically change colour. Click on the text to make the change:
![Show Fill (bucket) tool](images/from-me-fill-bucket.png){:width="150px"}

If you want each word in your message to be a different colour, size, and font, then follow the process above for each word in your message.

Position your text and/or group of words with the crosshair in the centre of the Paint editor:
![Show crosshair](images/from-me-paint-editor-centre.png){:width="400px"}

To layer your words, use the **Forward** and **Backward** tools:

title: Create a sprite with gaps that you can see through

---

You can create a sprite that has gaps that you can see through. If it is positioned as the front layer and is the size of the Stage, it can appear like a view through the bars of a cage or a series of windowpanes.

To create a type of masking sprite:
+ Go to **Choose a Sprite** and select **Paint**.
+ Choose a **Fill** colour with no **Outline** and draw a vertical rectangle. 
+ Use the **Copy** and **Paste** tools to repeat this shape. 
+ Use the **Select** tool to move the shapes around.
+ As you place your shapes, make sure that they are touching the edge of the Stage to fit in with your project idea.
