## Duplicate sprites and copy code

Duplicating or copying code can save you time when making a project.

Duplicate blocks or sets of blocks to reuse in a sprite's program:

* Go to the **Code** tab.
* Right-click (or on a tablet, tap and hold) on the first block that you want to copy. It will select all the blocks below it too.
* Select **Duplicate** in the drop-down menu.

* Drag the duplicated code where you want it to go.

* Delete any blocks that you do not need.

Create a new sprite and copy over all or some of the first sprite's code.

title: Copy a sprite's code

---
In the bottom right-hand corner of the Sprite list, click on **Choose a Sprite** and select the sprite that you want to add.

Click on the first sprite and go to its **Code** tab. Drag the code that is in the first sprite's Code area to the image of the second sprite in the Sprite list, then let go of the code to finish copying it to the second sprite. You may have one script that starts with a `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} block, as well as another script that starts with `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"}. Make sure that you copy **all** the code scripts that you have created.

Your second sprite will now have exactly the same code as your first sprite. Do not run the program until you have started to change the second sprite's code â€” you might not see the second sprite because it might be positioned underneath the first sprite.

If you want to copy costumes, sprites, sounds, and scripts between projects, drag them into the **Backpack**.
