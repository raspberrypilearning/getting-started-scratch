## Duplicate sprites and copy code

Choose one of these four methods to copy code:

--- task ---

Duplicate blocks or sets of blocks to reuse in a sprite's program:

<mark>the below task could be turned into a collapse and introduced in one of the Design projects</mark>

* Go to the **Code** tab.
* Right-click on the first block you want to copy (or if you are using a tablet, tap and hold). It will copy all the blocks below it as well.
* Select 'Duplicate' from the dropdown options.
![Image select duplicate](images/scratchguide-duplicate.png){:width="300px"}
* Drag the duplicated code where you want it to go.
![Image select duplicate](images/scratchguide-drag.png){:width="300px"}
* Delete any blocks you don't require.

 Duplicate your first sprite if you want multiples of the same sprite:
 
  --- collapse ---
---

title: Duplicate a sprite

---

Right-click on your first sprite in the Sprite list below the Stage (or if you are using a tablet, tap and hold):
![Image right click first sprite](images/challenge1-right-click-sprite.png){:width="300px"}

Select **duplicate**. This will create a copy of your first sprite with the suffix '2':
![Image duplicate sprite](images/challenge1-duplicate-sprite.png){:width="300px"}

Rename your sprite:
![Image rename sprite](images/challenge1-rename-sprite.png){:width="300px"}

Your sprite's name will change in the Sprite list:
![Image change name in list](images/challenge1-sprite-list.png){:width="300px"}

Your second sprite has exactly the same code as your first sprite. Do not run the program until you have begun to alter the second sprite — you will not see the second sprite because it is sitting underneath the first sprite.

--- /collapse ---

Create a new sprite and copy over all or some of the first sprite's code:

--- collapse ---
---

title: Copy sprite code

---
In the Sprite pane, go to **Choose a Sprite** and select your second sprite.

Click the first sprite and go to its **Code** tab. Drag the code that is in the first sprite to the second sprite. You may have one script that starts with a `when the green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} block, as well as another script that starts with `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"}. Make sure you copy **all** the code scripts that you have created.

Your second sprite has exactly the same code as your first sprite. Do not run the program until you have begun to alter the second sprite — you will not see the second sprite because it is sitting underneath the first sprite.

--- /collapse ---

Drag into a **backpack** costumes, sprites, sounds and scripts that you want to copy between projects:

- Your Scratch backpack can be used to store costumes, sprites, sounds and scripts that you want to copy between projects.

- You can only access your own backpack and must be logged into your Scratch account to use it.

- Open your backpack by clicking on the **Backpack** tab at the bottom of the screen.
