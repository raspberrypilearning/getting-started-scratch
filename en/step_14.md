## What next?

This Getting started with Scratch guide aims to support you working with Scratch on our projects as well as on your own projects.

If you are new to Scratch, start with our beginner pathway, [Look after yourself](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/look-after-yourself){:target="_blank"}. The six projects take you through from introductory level to working independently. You can return to this guide when you need to remind yourself of the skills that you learn in these projects.

If you have completed all the projects in the Look after yourself pathway, then move on to the environmentally themed pathway, [Protect our planet](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/protect-our-planet){:target="_blank"}. In this pathway, you will harness the power of computing to explore our planet, whilst being introduced to procedures and clones.
