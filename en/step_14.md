## What next?

This guide, Getting started with Scratch, aims to support you to use Scratch in our projects, as well as in your own projects.

If you are new to Scratch, start with our beginner pathway, [Look after yourself](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/look-after-yourself){:target="_blank"}. The six projects in the pathway help you to learn different skills in Scratch, and to progress to making your own projects independently. You can return to this guide whenever you need to remind yourself of the skills that you learn in these projects.

If you have completed all the projects in the Look after yourself pathway, then move on to the environmentally themed pathway, [Protect our planet](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/protect-our-planet){:target="_blank"}. In this pathway, you will harness the power of computing to explore our planet, whilst being introduced to procedures and clones.
