## Extensions

You can add `extensions`{:class="block3extensions"} to Scratch that add new blocks to the blocks menu with additional features.

[[[scratch3-text-to-speech]]]

[[[generic-scratch3-add-pen-extension]]]

[[[generic-scratch3-add-music-extension]]]

There are also Video Sensing and Translate extensions.

If you are using a Raspberry Pi computer then you can also use extensions for using electronics with the Raspberry Pi (you will need extra components or a Sense Hat):
