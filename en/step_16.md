## Important words

**Sprites** are characters and objects that appear on the stage which can be controlled by Scratch blocks, including being moved.

**Stage**. The Stage is the area where the sprites operate in Scratch. The Stage can have backdrops and can controlled using Scratch blocks but cannot move.

**Costumes**. Sprites may have multiple costumes. Changing the costume changes the appearance of a sprite, and can be used for effects such as giving the appearance of walking.

**Backdrop**. The stage can have a backdrop or even mulitple backdrops. Changing the backdrop can be used for effects such as changing the location in a story, or moving onto a new level of a game.

**code** is made up of Scratch blocks that give instructions to the sprites and the stage to perform a certain function, such as moving around the stage. 

**blocks** refers to the visual code blocks that are put together in Scratch to give instructions to the stage and the sprites.

**script**. A script is a series of blocks that are joined together to give instructions to the stage or sprites. The stage and sprites may each have many different scripts.

**Hat blocks** start code running when a particular event happens. Hat blocks have a different shape. Examples:

```blocks3
when flag clicked

when this sprite clicked
```

**loops** are blocks that make code repeat itself in a loop. The most simple repeat loops make a piece of code repeat a set number of times or repeat forever (until the programme is stopped).
