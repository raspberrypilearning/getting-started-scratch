## Editing tips
It's useful to learn how to copy and delete code blocks, and duplicate sprites. 

**Tip:** You can use <kbd>Ctrl-z</kbd> (hold down the Ctrl key and tap 'z') to undo lots of actions in Scratch. If you accidentally delete a Sprite or other item, you can use **Restore** from the **Edit** menu to get it back. 

You can delete code blocks you don't need any more:

Duplicating or copying code can save you time when making a project.

Duplicate blocks or sets of blocks to reuse in a sprite's program:

* Go to the **Code** tab.
* Right-click (or on a tablet, tap and hold) on the first block that you want to copy. It will select all the blocks below it too.
* Select **Duplicate** in the drop-down menu.

* Drag the duplicated code where you want it to go.

* Delete any blocks that you do not need.

Create a new sprite and copy over all or some of the first sprite's code.

In the bottom right-hand corner of the Sprite list, click on **Choose a Sprite** and select the sprite that you want to add.

Click on the first sprite and go to its **Code** tab. Drag the code that is in the first sprite's Code area to the image of the second sprite in the Sprite list, then let go of the code to finish copying it to the second sprite. You may have one script that starts with a `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} block, as well as another script that starts with `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"}. Make sure that you copy **all** the code scripts that you have created.

Your second sprite will now have exactly the same code as your first sprite. Do not run the program until you have started to change the second sprite's code — you might not see the second sprite because it might be positioned underneath the first sprite.

If you want to copy costumes, sprites, sounds, and scripts between projects, drag them into the **Backpack**.

It's always worth spending some time making sure you have followed best practices so your project is easy to understand.

- Name all sprites, costumes, sounds, variables, and messages sensibly. It’s much easier to understand projects that use helpful names.
- Fill in the Project Page with a good title, instructions, and notes so that users know how to use your project and where you got ideas from.
- Add short comments that explain what your code is doing.
- Make sure your scripts are tidy in the **Code** tab. You can right-click and choose **Clean up Blocks** or arrange the scripts in a way that makes sense to you. Try and put similar scripts together.
