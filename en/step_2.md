If your screen is big enough then you can have Scratch side by side with project instructions. 

On Windows 10, drag the Scratch tab in your web browser so that it is in a separate Window. Then hold the 'Windows' key and tap the 'light arrow' key. This will make Scratch appear in a window in the right half of your screen.

Now click on your project instructions window and hold the 'Windows' key and tap the 'left arrow' key. 

You can resize the windows to get them just the way you want.
