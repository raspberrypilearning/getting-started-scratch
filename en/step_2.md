If your screen is big enough, you can view Scratch next to the project instructions.

If you are using Microsoft Windows 10, drag the Scratch tab in your web browser so that it is in a separate window, and keep dragging until the cursor reaches the right-hand edge of your screen. The window will then be positioned on the right-hand side of the screen. 

Now, drag the window containing this guide or your project instructions to the left-hand side of your screen until the cursor reaches the left-hand edge. The window will take up the left half of your screen.

You can resize the windows to get them just the way you want.

**Tip:** You can also hold down the <kbd>Windows</kbd> key and press the <kbd>Left</kbd> arrow key or <kbd>Right</kbd> arrow key to position a window in the left or right half of your screen.

When you are using Scratch in a web browser, you can zoom in or out to adjust the size. 

For example, if you are using Microsoft Windows and you want to use zoom on a webpage in Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, hold down the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key and press the <kbd>+</kbd> key or <kbd>-</kbd> key to zoom in or out.
