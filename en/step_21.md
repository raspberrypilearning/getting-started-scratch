## Our Scratch projects

This reference guide, Getting started with Scratch, aims to support you to use Scratch in our projects, as well as in your own projects.

Our Scratch paths each have six projects to help you to learn different skills in Scratch, and to progress to making your own projects independently. You can return to this guide whenever you need to remind yourself of the skills you have learned.
