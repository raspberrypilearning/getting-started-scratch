## Sprites and backdrops

--- task ---

Add a backdrop of your choice. Don't worry about it too much, as you can change it as you develop your idea. Below are some **Information** tips, you can use these if you need a reminder, or to understand blocks in more detail.

Choose one of these three methods to create your second sprite: 
+ Duplicate your first sprite if you want multiples of the same sprite
+ Create a new sprite and copy over the first sprite's code 
+ Create a new sprite and start coding it from the beginning

title: Duplicate a sprite

---

Right-click on your first sprite in the Sprite list below the Stage (or if you are using a tablet, tap and hold):
![Image right click first sprite](images/challenge1-right-click-sprite.png){:width="300px"}

Select **duplicate**. This will create a copy of your first sprite with the suffix '2':
![Image duplicate sprite](images/challenge1-duplicate-sprite.png){:width="300px"}

Rename your sprite:
![Image rename sprite](images/challenge1-rename-sprite.png){:width="300px"}

Your sprite's name will change in the Sprite list:
![Image change name in list](images/challenge1-sprite-list.png){:width="300px"}

Your second sprite has exactly the same code as your first sprite. Do not run the program until you have begun to alter the second sprite — you will not see the second sprite because it is sitting underneath the first sprite.

title: Copy sprite code

---
In the Sprite pane, go to **Choose a Sprite** and select your second sprite.

Click the first sprite and go to its **Code** tab. Drag the code that is in the first sprite to the second sprite. You may have one script that starts with a `when the green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} block, as well as another script that starts with `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"}. Make sure you copy **all** the code scripts that you have created.
