## Using Scratch

This 'Getting started with Scatch' guide aims to support you working with Scratch on our projects as well as more independently.

If you're new to Scratch, start with our beginner pathway [Look after yourself](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/look-after-yourself){:target="_blank"} where six projects take you through from introductory level to working independently, with support, where required from this Getting started with Scatch guide.

If you have completed all the projects in the 'Look after yourself' pathway, then move on to the environmentally themed pathway, [Protect our planet](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/protect-our-planet){:target="_blank"}. In this pathway, you will harness the power of computing to explore our planet, whilst being introduced to procedures and clones.

Sprites are characters and objects that appear on the stage which can be controlled by Scratch blocks, including being moved.

The Stage is the area where the sprites are active in Scratch. The Stage can have backdrops and can be controlled using Scratch blocks but the Stage cannot move.

There are colour coded categories of blocks: `Motion`{:class="block3motion"}, `Looks`{:class="block3looks"}, `Sound`{:class="block3sound"}, `Events`{:class="block3events"}, `Control`{:class="block3control"}, `Sensing`{:class="block3sensing"}, `Operators`{:class="block3operators"}, `Variables`{:class="block3variables"}, and `My Blocks`{:class="block3myblocks"}. There are also most blocks in `Extensions`{:class="block3extensions"}.

You can drag blocks towards each other o make programs - they snap together.

Click on code blocks to run them. You can also click on the `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} to run your program.

`Event`{:class="block3events"} blocks start all scripts. They have a different top shape which is rounded. You always need to add an `Event`{:class="block3events"} block for **when** your sprite should do something. `Event`{:class="block3events"} blocks start code running when a particular event happens, such as a user clicking.

```blocks3
when green flag clicked

```

These blocks have a different shape â€” they are sometimes called **Hat blocks**. They start code running when a particular event happens, such as a user clicking.

Now choose a Scratch beginner pathway to develop your skills:

+ [Scratch Module 1](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/codeclub/scratch-module-1) - Learn how to program your own interactive stories, games and animations. 
+ [Look After Yourself]() - Make projects that will help you to relax and take care of your wellbeing.

You can return to this guide when you need to remind yourself of the skills you learn in these projects.
