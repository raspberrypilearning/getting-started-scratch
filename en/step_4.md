## Using Scratch

Sprites are characters and objects that appear on the stage which can be controlled by Scratch blocks, including being moved.

The Stage is the area where the sprites are active in Scratch. The Stage can have backdrops and can be controlled using Scratch blocks but the Stage cannot move.

There are colour coded categories of blocks: `Motion`{:class="block3motion"}, `Looks`{:class="block3looks"}, `Sound`{:class="block3sound"}, `Events`{:class="block3events"}, `Control`{:class="block3control"}, `Sensing`{:class="block3sensing"}, `Operators`{:class="block3operators"}, `Variables`{:class="block3variables"}, and `My Blocks`{:class="block3myblocks"}. There are also most blocks in `Extensions`{:class="block3extensions"}.

You can drag blocks towards each other o make programs - they snap together.

Click on code blocks to run them. You can also click on the `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} to run your program.

`Event`{:class="block3events"} blocks start all scripts. They have a different top shape which is rounded. You always need to add an `Event`{:class="block3events"} block for **when** your sprite should do something. `Event`{:class="block3events"} blocks start code running when a particular event happens, such as a user clicking.

```blocks3

```

These blocks have a different shape â€” they are sometimes called **Hat blocks**. They start code running when a particular event happens, such as a user clicking.
