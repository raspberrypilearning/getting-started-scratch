## Using Scratch

Sprites are characters and objects that appear on the stage which can be controlled by Scratch blocks, including being moved.

The Stage is the area where the sprites are active in Scratch. The Stage can have backdrops and can be controlled using Scratch blocks but the Stage cannot move.

There are colour coded categories of blocks: `Motion`{:class="block3motion"}, `Looks`{:class="block3looks"}, `Sound`{:class="block3sound"}, `Events`{:class="block3events"}, `Control`{:class="block3control"}, `Sensing`{:class="block3sensing"}, `Operators`{:class="block3operators"}, `Variables`{:class="block3variables"}, and `My Blocks`{:class="block3myblocks"}. There are also most blocks in `Extensions`{:class="block3extensions"}.

You can drag blocks together to make programs - as you drag them towards each other they snap together.

`Event`{:class="block3events"} blocks like `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} to run your program start all scripts. `Event`{:class="block3events"} blocks have a runded top shape which means you cannt add a block above them. You always need an `Event`{:class="block3events"} block for **when** your sprite or backdrop does something. `Event`{:class="block3events"} blocks start code running when a particular event happens, such as `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"}.

```blocks3
when green flag clicked
when this sprite clicked
```

When you are developing your programs you can click on the code blocks to run them.
