## What is what in Scratch

--- task ---

**Sprites** are characters and objects that appear on the stage which can be controlled by Scratch blocks, including being moved.

Sprites may have multiple **costumes**. Changing the costume changes the appearance of a sprite, and can be used for effects such as giving the appearance of walking.

The **Stage** is the area where the sprites are active in Scratch. The Stage can have backdrops and can be controlled using Scratch blocks but the Stage cannot move.

**Backdrop**. The stage can have a backdrop or even mulitple backdrops. Changing the backdrop can be used for effects such as changing the location in a story, or moving onto a new level of a game.

**code** is made up of Scratch blocks that give instructions to the sprites and the stage to perform a certain function, such as moving around the stage. 

**Blocks** refer to the visual code blocks that are put together in Scratch to give instructions to the stage and the sprites.
