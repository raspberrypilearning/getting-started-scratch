## Your first Scratch project

When you create a new Scratch project it includes a cat sprite. 

Drag blocks from the blocks menu to the code area to make the cat do something. 

Try, dragging a `move`{:class="block3sound"} block from the `Motion`{:class="block3sound"} menu. The blocks are colour-coded to help you find them.

![Move block](images/move-block.png)

You can click on blocks in the code area to run them. Click on the move block and the cat will move. 

**Hat blocks** run the blocks underneath them when a particular event happens. The `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} block runs code when you click on the green flag above the stage to run your project. 

Drag a `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} block above the `move` block so that they snap together.

![Flag clicked](images/move-block.png)

Your code should look like this:

```blocks3
when flag clicked
move (10) steps
```

**Tip**: Scratch blocks are colour-coded so you will find `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} in the `Events`{:class="block3events"} menu. 

Now click on the green flag above the stage and the cat will move.

title: How do I name and save my project?

Go to **File** in the menu. If you have a Scratch account, click on **Save now**. If you do not have an account, click on **Save to your computer**.

Click in the project name box and change the name to match your project. 

![Project name highlighted](images/change-project-name.png)

If you share your project, then other people will also see this name, so make sure that it makes sense.
