## Getting started with Scratch

It's useful to know your way around the Scratch editor.

The **Stage** is where the action takes place in your project. The Stage has one or more background images called **backdrops** 

**Sprites** are characters and objects which appear on the **Stage**. Sprites are given instructions using Scratch code blocks, this is called programming. 

Drag **Code blocks** from the **Blocks menu** to the **Code area** to program your sprites and the Stage. Code blocks can make a sprite move around, change the way it looks and play sounds. 

Sprites can have multiple **costumes**. Changing the costume changes the appearance of a sprite, and can be used for effects such as giving the appearance of walking. 

A **script** is a series of blocks that are joined together to give instructions to the stage or sprites. The stage and sprites may each have many different scripts.
