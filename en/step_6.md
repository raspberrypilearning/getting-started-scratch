Reference for beginner blocks including drop-down options and input ranges


```blocks3
set size to (100)%
```

100% is the normal size (edit the costume to change how big this is).
50% is half the normal size
200% is double the normal size


```blocks3
set [color v] effect to (100)
```

+ `color`{:class="block3looks"}: from 0 to 199 (bigger numbers will wrap around so 200 is the same as 0)
+ `fisheye`{:class="block3looks"}: 0 is no effect and bigger numbers give a bigger 'bulge' effect
+ `whirl`{:class="block3looks"}: 0 is no effect, big number give a big whirl to the left, big negative number give a big whirl to the right
+ `pixelate`{:class="block3looks"}: 0 is no effect, bigger numbers give more pixels
+ `mosaic`{:class="block3looks"}: 0 is no effect, bigger numbers create more copies
+ `brightness`{:class="block3looks"}: 0 is no effect, bigger numbers up to 100 make the sprite lighter and negative numbers down to -100 make the sprite darker 
+ `ghost`{:class="block3looks"}: 0 is no effect, bigger numbers up to 100 make the sprite more transparent
