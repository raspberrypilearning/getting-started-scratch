title: What to put in Instructions and Notes and Credits
---

On the Project Page, you can fill in the Instructions to explain how to use your project, and complete your projectâ€™s Notes and Credits.

In the **Instructions** box, tell people how to use your project:
+ Include all the instructions that the user needs to explore your project fully.
+ Make sure that your instructions are given step by step and are simple. Instructions are easier to read if you write them in a list.
+ Include all the user interaction, such as clicking on the green flag to start, and which sprites to click on.
+ Let the user know if the project includes sound, as they may need to wear headphones or turn the volume up on their device.

In the **Notes and Credits** box:
+ Thank the people who created the projects that inspired you. You could even include the web addresses of the projects.
+ Did you include images or sounds that were created by someone else? If so, credit the source(s) in this box.
