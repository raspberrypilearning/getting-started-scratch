On Microsoft Windows 10, drag the Scratch tab in your web browser so that it is in a separate window, and keep dragging until the cursor reaches the right-hand side of your screen. The window will then be positioned on the right-hand side of the screen.

Now, drag the window containing this guide or your project instructions to the left of your screen until the cursor reaches the left edge. The window will take up the left half of your screen.

You can resize the windows to get them just the way you want.

**Tip:** You can also hold the <kbd>Windows</kbd> key and press the <kbd>Left</kbd> arrow key or <kbd>Right</kbd> arrow key to position a window on the left or right half of your screen.
