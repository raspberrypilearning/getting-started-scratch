## Your first Scratch project

![Scratch editor with key features labelled](images/scratch-features.png)

--- task --- When you create a new Scratch project, it includes a cat sprite.

Drag blocks from the Blocks menu to the Code area to make the cat do something.

To try an example, drag a `move`{:class="block3motion"} block from the `Motion`{:class="block3motion"} blocks menu. The blocks are colour-coded to help you find them.

![Move block](images/move-block.png)

You can click on blocks in the Code area to run them. Click on the `move`{:class="block3motion"} block and the cat will move.

**Hat blocks** run the blocks below them when a particular event happens. The `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} block runs code when you click on the green flag above the Stage to run your project.

Drag a `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} block above the `move`{:class="block3motion"} block so that they snap together.

![Flag clicked](images/move-block.png)

Your code should look like this:

```blocks3
when flag clicked
move (10) steps
```

**Tip:** Scratch blocks are colour-coded, so you will find the `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} block in the `Events`{:class="block3events"} blocks menu.

Now, click on the green flag above the Stage and the cat will move.
