## Seu primeiro projeto Scratch

Quando você cria um novo projeto Scratch, ele inclui um **Gato** como ator.

Arraste os blocos do menu Blocos para a área Código para fazer o gato fazer alguma coisa.

Para tentar um exemplo, arraste a bloco `mova`{:class="block3motion"} da categoria `Movimento`{:class="block3motion"}. Os blocos são coloridos para ajudá-lo a encontrá-los.

Você pode clicar nos blocos na área de Código para executá-los. Clique no bloco `mova`{:class="block3motion"} e o gato se moverá.

**Dica:** Se estiver usando o Scratch em um tablet, você pode tocar em um item para clicar nele.

**Hat blocks** run the blocks below them when a particular event happens. The `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} block runs code when you click on the green flag above the Stage to run your project.

Drag a `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} block above the `move`{:class="block3motion"} block so that they snap together.

![The 'move' block in the Code area.](images/green-flag-script.png)

Your code should look like this:

```blocks3
when flag clicked
move (10) steps
```

**Tip:** Scratch blocks are colour-coded, so you will find the `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} block in the `Events`{:class="block3events"} blocks menu.

Now, click on the green flag above the Stage and the cat will move.

If you share your project, then other people will also see this name, so make sure that it makes sense.

You have created your first Scratch project!

You are now ready to learn Scratch. We recommend that you start with our [Scratch: Module 1](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/scratch-module-1){:target="_blank"} and/or [Look after yourself](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/look-after-yourself){:target="_blank"} pathways, which are designed for beginners.

 You can return to this guide if you need help using Scratch when you are working on our pathway projects or on your own independent projects.
